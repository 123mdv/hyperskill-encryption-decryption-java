# hyperskill-encryption-decryption-java

This is a Java learning project from Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy, more details here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/46?goal=7

In this project, I implemented a program that can do basic encryption and decryption of a text. Using command line arguments, the user can choose various options for data input and output, which algorithm and key to use and, of course, whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.
